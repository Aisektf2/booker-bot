# BOOKER BOT
Discord to IRC bridge for ozfortress server booking. Allows Discord users to type in IRC booking commands, and will be PM'd relevant information.

It just runs as a standalone nodejs console application I guess?

## Discord commands
**/book** - Book a new server under user's Discord username

**/unbook** - Unbook server

**/demos <user>** - Get STV demo repository for specified user

**/help** - Displays commands

## Required Modules
[discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/)    ```bash npm install --no-optional discord.js```
